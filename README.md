# BasicUnityProceduralTileGen
Very basic unity procedural title gen 


Insurctions , clone the repo and open up BreakieWall in the Assets folder. I wanted to see if I could make a breakable wall effect, but simply 
switch the'Tower' prefab refrenced  in the TileGen object to a different block. 

For now this will ONLY generate tiles in 2 dimensions, as the project progresses I plan to add more options. 
Also , this ONLY will run at runtime, but I'm working on a 'bake' scene option.
